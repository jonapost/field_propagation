RKTest - Readme

//RKTest is a basic test for the RK steppers.
//It is the combination of various previous tests written 
as a part of this project.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Create an object of the class RKTest
//Code------------
RKTest mytest:
//End Code
2. Call a member function pertaining to a certain test 
//Code------------
myTest.function_Name_with_proper_syntax(args... )
//End Code--------

------DONE-------

DETAILS
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Test A stepper using a fixed step size in a Uniform 
Magnetic Field
//Code------------
#include "RKTest.hh" //RKTest-suite
#include "G4CashKarpRKF45.hh" //Stepper to test

RKTest mytest;
int columns[] = {1,1,0,0,0,0}
mytest.testSteppersFixedUMF<G4CashKarpRKF45>(columns);
//End Code--------

Here we call the function testSteppersFixedUMF( ) with
its default parameters and pass the columns array.
This array specifies the coordinates we want to see in
the output (with the standard 6-cooridnate convention 
of Geant4. For each coordinate, we have 3 columns : 
yOut[i], yErr[i], and yOut[i]-yOut[i].
The function declaration reads :

template < class STEPPER >
testSteppersFixedUMF(int columns[6],
                         	G4double factor = 1. ,
                             G4double step_len = 25.0*CLHEP::mm,
                             int no_of_steps = 100 )

        factor specifies the field strength; pass factor=10 for
        a 10 times stronger field.

    2. Test a G4 Stepper's performance
   
    //Code - continued
    G4double myFieldFac = 10.
       	myTest.testAnyG4Stepper<G4CashKarpRKF45>("umf", myFieldFac);
//End Code--------

The string "umf" specifies that we want to use Uniform
Magnetic Field. One can also use "qmf".

3. Test an FSAL Stepper (using FSALDriver)
Here the code is necessarily the same with the only
difference being you should instantiate using only
an FSAL stepper.

//Code 
myTest.testFSALStepper<FDormandPrince745>("qmf",0.1);
//End Code

4. Test interpolation of a capable stepper

//Code -------
myTest.testStepperInterpolant<VernerRK78, G4CashKarpRKF45>(columns);
//End Code ---------

Here the first class is the one that is under test and the 
other one is the reference stepper class whose reduced 
step_len steps would be used as a reference to compare the
accuracy of interpolation.

The declaration :

   template<class STEPPER, class REF_STEPPER>
   void testStepperInterpolant(int columns[6],
                                G4double step_len_pi_divisor = 6.0,
                                G4double maxAngle = 2.0*CLHEP::pi,
                                G4double factor = 1.,
                               std::string field_code = "umf")
